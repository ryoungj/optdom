# OptDom: Learning Optimal Representations for Domain Generalization

This repository contains the official implementation for [Optimal Representations for Covariate Shift](todo). 
Our paper theoretically characterizes the minimal sufficient representations for optimal domain generalization (DG) under covariate shift and derives practical self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives for learning such representations.

We provide code for reproducing our main results with contribution highlights:
* Finetuning pretrained SSL models ([CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)) to be superior robust DG models
* A novel contrastive adversarial domain bottleneck for learning domain-invariant representations

**Code coming soon!**
